                <p>Hi, I'm Jalen. I've written this website from the ground up as a portfolio and resume for myself, my peers, and my employers. I grew up in Sacramento, California and have enjoyed living here ever since. I started working with computers in my childhood, but in high school I was able to learn some front end web development, which sparked my interest in computer science. As I finished high school I chose CSC as my major at Sac State.</p>

                <p>At Sac State I was excited to get experience with coding outside of web development. Java is the primary language taught at CSUS, and through it I learned the basic concepts of computer programming. As I have continued toward completing my degree, I have also learned some C, SQL, Python, JavaScript and expanded on my existing web/mobile development knowledge.</p>

                <p>I spend my free time doing a variety of things, including coding! My coding hobbies include game development in Unreal Engine, modding videogames and making websites for myself and others. One of my other hobbies is nature photography (the photos on this page are my own!). I love board games, recreational sports, hiking, videogames and language learning.</p>
