                <p>Hi, I'm Jalen. I've written this website from the ground up as a portfolio and resume for myself, my peers, and my employers. I grew up in Sacramento, California and have lived here ever since. Ever since I started working with computers in my childhood, I always took an interest to getting an in-depth understanding of them. At first, I just tried to optimize my old laptops so I could play videogames, but in high school I was able to learn some front end web development, which sparked my interest in computer science.</p>

            <div class="about-txt-container-right">
                <p>As I started at Sac State I was excited to get experience with coding outside of web development. Java is the primary language taught at CSUS, and throught it I learned the basic concepts of computer programming. As I have continued toward completing my degree, I have also learned some C, SQL, Python, JavaScript and more.</p>
